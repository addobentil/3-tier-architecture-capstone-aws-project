# Building Scalability and Resilience: Transforming Customer Experience with AWS 3-Tier Architecture

## Capstone Project Challenge:

You have been tasked with addressing the infrastructure challenges of **ShopEase**, an expanding e-commerce company facing significant limitations with its existing platform. With growing traffic, ShopEaseâ€™s current website suffers from slow load times and occasional outages, causing customer frustration and lost sales.

Your capstone project aims to implement a scalable, reliable solution by designing and deploying a **3-tier architecture on AWS**. This approach will separate the presentation, application, and data layers to improve performance, enhance security, and provide a seamless shopping experience for customers.

## Overview:

In this project, I will guide you through the process of manually configuring a scalable and resilient e-commerce platform leveraging a **3-tier architecture** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. This architecture includes the **Web Tier**, **Application Tier**, and **Database Tier**, each serving a specific purpose in the platform.

## Objectives:

- Create a **Comprehensive Architectural Diagram** illustrating the arrangement of the Web Tier, Application Tier, and Database Tier.
- Carefully plan and allocate the **CIDR block** for the VPC and Subnets before their creation.
- Configure both **Public and Private Route Tables** as necessary.
- Set up a **NAT Gateway** within a Public Subnet to allow instances within Private Subnets to access the internet for package updates and patches.
- Employ a **Bastion Host** in the Public Subnet.
- Enable communication between the Web Tier and Application Tier, and **Ping Application Tier from Web Tier**.

## Prerequisites:

- **AWS account** (free-tier)
- Basic knowledge of **AWS console and resources**
- **Secure Shell (SSH)** access to your server
- **GitHub account**
